# Brunch with Brogrammers :facepunch: 
This is a fork of the awesome Ember skeleton [Tapas with Ember](https://gemnasium.com/mutewinter/tapas-with-ember),
that has been transformed for our needs.

Our inital thoughts were:
  - Use only JavaScript-based tools. We have replaced original deploy script (ruby-based) with DIY cake task that uses `rsync`.
  - Use `emblem.js` as the main template language.
